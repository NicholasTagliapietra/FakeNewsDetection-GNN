# Fake news detection using Graph Neural Networks


## Abstract

Fake news are the new plague of the 21st century. With the advent of social
networks and the easy and quick access to information, this disease has become
more and more common. Through retweets, shares or likes, a piece of fabricated
information can in a few moments gain real credibility thanks to the common
”validation”. Similar to the tragedy of the common, each user is selfish and does
not take the time to verify the sources, preferring to believe in this information
that is often incredible, revolutionary and built to make the buzz. However,
for several years now, various methods have been used on social networks to
address these problems by detecting and removing problematic messages from
the platform as quickly as possible. Our objective is to analyse the state of
the art of these methods, to implement a graph-based solution and to see if
adding node-level features helps to increase the prediction score. We will take
the example of Twitter and model a graph for each tweet posted. Finally, we will
use the a version of the FakeNewsNet dataset [5] which is one of the reference
dataset for this type of task.
